There is a nextcloud web page, keycloak web page and customer web page behind nginx inside a single VPC and running on a single EC2 instance.  NextCloud and Keycloak share same mariadb database. Data is stored in S3 and will be accessed from nextcloud. Nginx is the reverse web proxy and handles all web traffic. Docker containers are running on a single EC2 instance that is using RHEL 8. All resources are in a single VPC. Connect keycloak to nextcloud for authentication. The customer web page requires no Keycloak authentication. Put a user outside the VPC emulating accessing the website.
